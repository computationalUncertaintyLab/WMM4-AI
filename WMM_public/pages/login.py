                * To infect, navigate to "User Input" (*most important page*)
                * To view contacts, navigate to "Contact network infections"
                * To view cases over time, navigate to "Cases over time"

                ### Research Consent
                This research study aims to generate a contact network of successful transmissions of the watermelon-meow-meow pathogen.
                We hypothesize that a student-driven, real-time outbreak of a **fictitious** pathogen will improve student comprehension of course material. 

                **What data is collected from me?**: We collect, and will present on this app, your Lehigh username (i.e. the three letter and three number combination from your Lehigh email address. For example, thm220).

                **How will my data be used?**: We plan to build a contact network over time that will present Lehigh usernames. This will be public and presented on the `Contact Network Infections' page.
                In addition, your connections to others will be used in class to simulate an outbreak to understand the mathematics of the spread of disease over a contact network. 


                **Contacts and Questions**: If you have questions about the research study itself, please contact the Investigators: Thomas McAndrew (mcandrew@lehigh.edu). If you have questions about your rights or would simply like to speak with someone other than the research team about questions or concerns, please contact the IRB at (610) 758-2871 or inirb@lehigh.edu. All reports or correspondence will be kept confidential.

                **Statement of Consent:** I have read the above information. I have had the opportunity to ask questions and have my questions answered. By adding my Lehigh Username, I consent to participate in this study.
