1. You can infect students, staff, or professors, anyone with a lehigh account. You are also allowed to infect more than one person at a time. The only rule is that you need to be INPERSON with the individual(s). 
2. Open up this link https://wmm-2026.streamlit.app/ and login with your Lehigh username (the letters and numbers before @lehigh.edu).
3. Navigate to “User Input”
4. You should explain that lehigh usernames will be included in a public facing app.
5. Watch together the 1-min video.
6. Add your name to the Infector textbox, the person you are infecting to the “Infectee” text box and press submit.
